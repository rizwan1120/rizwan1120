                                    Since I began freelancing just over a year ago, I’ve had the opportunity to work
                                    with nearly a dozen high-growth startups and world-class experts. And I’ve never had
                                    to negotiate for the premium prices I charge for my content marketing services,
                                    which is why I’d like to share some tips with you on how to start freelancing and
                                    how to make money doing so, even if you’re a complete beginner.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Because I’ve done such an effective job of defining my value propositions, branding
                                    myself as an expert within my field, and getting my freelance writing content in
                                    front of new target audiences, I now have a 3–6 month waiting list for new freelance
                                    clients and freelance jobs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, that certainly didn’t happen overnight. My rapid success in the world of
                                    freelancing is the result of a LOT of strategic positioning, hours of hard work, and
                                    good timing.

                                        That’s why it’s worth investing time into deciding what to feature on your
                                        portfolio and how it’s being displayed — before you start looking for new

                                    <p>I’m a huge fan of starting a freelance business while you keep your day job (or
                                        work part-time), as opposed to immediately pursuing self-employment.

                                        In addition to the fact that creating a high-quality portfolio website, building

                                        of time, it’s a good idea to have a few steady freelance clients on your roster
                                        before axing your sole source of income.

                                        I recommend growing your side income to at least 50–75% of your total current

                                    <p>There’s an art and science to pitching your freelance services to new clients.

                                    <p>
                                        Landing new clients isn’t just a matter of crafting an awesome freelance
                                        proposal. Your success depends on how you’re selecting new jobs, how you
                                        position your value propositions, and how much research you do ahead of time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I’ve won new gigs simply because I clearly put in more time and effort into
                                        researching the company, determining their needs, and providing immense up front
                                        value in the form of insightful recommendations before I even discuss payment.
                                        In the world of freelancing, much of your success (and ability to make money
                                        online) will depend upon the strength of your client relationships, and how well
                                        you’re able to forge meaningful partnerships.

                                        clients. What better way to increase the number of potential new clients coming
                                        across your website than by creating high quality blog content that positions
                                        you as a stand out expert within your field?

                                    <p>
                                        At the beginning, aim for creating one or two in-depth blog posts per month,
                                        geared toward providing truly helpful solutions that your potential clients may
                                        be searching for. Note: That means you’ll be writing for an audience of your
                                        clients, not other people in your field.

                                        Once they discover your content and get some free value from you, you’ll
                                        naturally be top-of-mind if they’re ready to hire out for more in-depth help.

                                        that you offer freelance services, one of the most effective ways to increase
                                        your online visibility is by getting content published on the blogs and
                                        publications where your potential customers spend the most time.

                                        While you’ll be starting on a much smaller scale, don’t underestimate the
                                        immediate benefit of getting your content featured on blogs and publications
                                        that can drive hundreds or even thousands of new visitors to your website.

                                        Entrepreneur, Inc, Business Insider, HubSpot, and dozens more publications by
                                        creating extremely high quality content and leveraging my pitching abilities.
                                        This increased visibility has had a direct, positive impact on my business.
